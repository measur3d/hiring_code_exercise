# 3D App Developer Exercise
You should have been directed to this repository and branch from the
hiring questionnaire. If you have any questions, please let our hiring
recruiter know!

## Coding Exercise

As a developer, you will be responsible for maintaining stability and
extending functionality of an existing C++ codebase for a 3D
application, as well as the related infrastructure, testing, and CI/CD
maintenance required to keep it running. In this part of the
questionnaire, you will need to complete several tasks in sample
codebase designed to simulate, at a very small scale, the kinds of
challenges you might experience in your day to day work. It also gives
us the chance to evaluate your thought processes and coding style.

## Setup

Clone the following repository:
https://github.com/measur3d/hiring\_code\_exercise.git and switch to
the branch `3d_apps_dev_2019`. Please do not push to public forks of
this repository, instead create your own fork which we will use for
evaluation upon completion. You will need to install Qt5. We have
tested it on OS X; you may need to modify some code to get it to work
on other systems. The project is a standard CMake project. Once you
have compiled the code, you should be able to execute the program
`CodeExercise` in the build directory. This project is fairly
simple. It presents a 3D view in which multiple 3D models can be
visualized and rotated in space. On the right hand side, there are
sliders that indicate the various degrees of rotation in Euler
angles. Underneath these is a combo box which allows selection of the
model to be displayed. Please play around in the application and get
familiar with the behaviors of all the interface elements.

## Tasks

Please refer to the questionnaire you were provided as part of the
hiring process for the specific tasks you should perform within this
exercise.
